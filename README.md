# CS4200_Artificial_Intelligence_Projects
 
# Project 1
## Coded in Visual Studio C/C++
## Using an A* heuristic search to solve the 8 tile sliding puzzle problem
## Two different heuristics are used, the sum of misplaced tiles, and the Manhattan distance

# Project 2
## Coded in Python
## Solving the 8-queen problem via a standard hill climb search and through simulated annealing
## Each 1 on the grid represents a queen and by the end state, all queens must not be attacking each other

# Project 3
## Coded in Visual Studio C/C++
## Connect 4 game using minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning
## Win states are determined by 4 in a row or 4 in column
